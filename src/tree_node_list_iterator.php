/**
 * ezcTreeNodeListIterator implements an iterator over an ezcTreeNodeList.
 *
 * The iterator is instantiated with both an implementation of an ezcTree and
 * an ezcTreeNodeList object. It can be used to iterate over all the nodes
 * in a list.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 *     // fetch all the nodes in a subtree as an ezcNodeList
 *     $nodeList = $tree->fetchSubtree( 'pan' );
 *     foreach ( new ezcTreeNodeListIterator( $tree, $nodeList ) as $nodeId => $data )
 *     {
 *         // do something with the node ID and data - data is fetched on
 *         // demand
 *     }
 * ?>
 * </code>
 *
 * Data for the nodes in the node lists is fetched on demand, unless
 * the "prefetch" argument is set to true. In that case the iterator will
 * fetch the data when the iterator is instantiated. This reduces the number
 * of queries made for database and persistent object based data stores, but
 * increases memory usage.
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 * <?php
 *     // fetch all the nodes in a subtree as an ezcNodeList
 *     $nodeList = $tree->fetchSubtree( 'Uranus' );
 *     // instantiate an iterator with pre-fetching enabled
 *     foreach ( new ezcTreeNodeListIterator( $tree, $nodeList, true ) as $nodeId => $data )
 *     {
 *         // do something with the node ID and data - data is fetched when
 *         // the iterator is instatiated.
 *     }
 * ?>
 * </code>
